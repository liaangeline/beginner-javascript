// ---------------- DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL (DOM) -------------------------
When the HTML is ina webpage, it gets converted into the DOM. 
This allows us to interact with the DOM via Javascript ie.listen to click, scrolls, add, modify elements etc

DOM - things that are on the page

remember - the global scope in the browser is called the WINDOW (window.___) Window is where all our globar
variables are stored as well as properties like windows.location you can even use innerWidth. 
the window is everything about the currently open window, which includes the scroll bar, tabs, etc. 

DOCUMENT - resposible from the opening html tag to the closing html tag (document.___) (NOT concerened about the outer stuff ie. tabs 
scroll bars etc. like the window. Only everything in the document (like the HTML code))

NAVIGATOR - information about the device itself. like webcam and audio access etc.
